A simple JS-free tracker to help track views anywhere you can add an `<img>` tag. (Works on Github, or your blog)

## ðŸ“‹ Approach

This is just a proof of concept project I wanted to write to understand how web tracking works. An `img` tag sends a GET request to a server, which counts views as well as extracts some information from the request. 

The extracted data is then used to create a payload object that is validated against a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) object before being processed.

The main idea here is that the server resolves a request with a `204 No Content` status code to the client, while recording the request in the background.

In order for the server to be resilient to high load, every request creates an event (once validated) which can then be added to a queue to be processed. This architecture ensures that the server is available even under high load, and we're able to process the events at a constant speed to ensure we do not lose any data due to a high number of requests.
